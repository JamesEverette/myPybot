# pybot
Bot application for slack. Uses WitAi machine learning to structure queries for MS SQL database and DynamoDB. Also uses my blockchain API to grab variables from personal ethereum blockchain's smart contracts hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. Falls back to Chatterbot retrieval bot when WitAi's confidence in its response is below a certain level. Chatterbot trained with the Ubuntu DialogCoprus.
